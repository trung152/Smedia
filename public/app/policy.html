      <h1>PRIVACY AND DATA POLICY</h1>
      <p><strong>ISSUED BY Free for Steamy Studio</strong></p>

      <h2>1. AN OVERVIEW ON DATA PROTECTION</h2>
      <h3>1.1 General information about this privacy policy</h3>
      <p>
        We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence, we
        handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance
        with the statutory data protection regulations and this Privacy Policy.
        Whenever you use our games, various personal data will be collected. The
        following information will provide you with an easy to navigate overview
        of which data we collect how as well as the purposes we use this data for
        when you play our games. The term "personal data" comprises all data that
        can be used to personally identify you, either directly (such as your
        first and last name, your email address or your telephone number), or
        indirectly (such as your phone ID, cookie identifier or game data). For
        detailed information about the subject matter of data protection, please
        consult our Privacy Policy below.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 Data Recording</h3>
      <p><strong>How do we collect your data?</strong></p>
      <p>
        On the one hand, your data is collected by you communicating it to us.
        This may be data that you enter in a contact form or if you connect your
        game to third-party accounts, such as Facebook or Google. Other data is
        automatically collected when you download and use our games. We also
        collect information about the advertisements served and how often you have
        viewed them, their location in the game and the identifier of your
        terminal device. We also collect information about your actions in
        relation to the advertisements, such as the page views, the time and the
        duration of the view.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What are the purposes we use your data for?</strong></p>
      <p>
        We use this data to provide our games to you, including for the purposes
        of optimization, processing support requests, preventing fraud,
        customizing and/or personalizing your game experience and in-game offers,
        verifying purchases and provide you with supplementary services. We may
        also use the data to provide you with advertisements, products, services
        or personalized content through our services or those of our partners. We
        may link the data we collect with our partners when you use our services.
        We may also link this data to demographic, advertising or market research
        or other analytical surveys.
      </p>

          >What rights do you have as far as your information is
          concerned?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        You have the right to receive information about the source, recipients and
        purposes of your archived personal data at any time without having to pay
        a fee for such disclosures. You also have the right to demand that your
        data are rectified or eradicated. Please do not hesitate to contact us at
        any time under the address disclosed on the imprint of this website if you

        agency. Moreover, you have the right to demand the restriction of the
        processing of your personal data. Details of how to exercise your rights
        can be found in this Privacy Policy under "Your Rights".

      <p><strong>Analysis tools and tools provided by third parties</strong></p>
      <p>
        If you download and use our games, your usage data may be statistically
        analyzed. Such analyses are performed primarily with what we refer to as
        analysis programs. The analyses of your usage data are usually conducted
        anonymously; i.e. the patterns cannot be traced back to you. For detailed
        information about the tools and about your options to object, please
        consult our Privacy Policy below.

      <h2>2. GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        The responsible party (referred to as the "controller" in the GDPR) is the
        natural person or legal entity that single handedly or jointly with others
        makes decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of
        personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.). The controller
        according to data protection laws is: Steamy Studio. If you have any
        questions or suggestions about data protection, you can send us an email
        to support@steamy-studio.com.
      </p>

      <h2>3. COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR DATA</h2>
      <h3>3.1. Player ID</h3>
      <p>
        When you first play our games, we may automatically create a pseudonymized
        user ID. We collect this data in order to provide you with access to our
        games, for example to your saved game and unlocked or purchased content,
        Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2. Social Features, Game Center</h3>
      <p>
        In some of our games you may also connect your player to third-party
        accounts such as your Facebook or Google account in order to participate
        in the Social Features and Highscores. You may also connect your game to
        your Game Center account. If you connect your Facebook account with our
        games, the following data is shared with us:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Profile picture</li>
        <li>Facebook ID</li>
        <li>Place of residence (if indicated by Facebook)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you connect your account to your Game Center account or other
        third-party accounts such as Google, we may collect a pseudonymized unique
        identifier per connected third party provider. Some of our games allow you
        to create a pseudonymized invitation link that you may send to your
        friends to connect directly via the Social Feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Please note:</strong> If you participate in the Social Features,
        your friends and contacts that also participate in the Social Feature of
        the same game may also see that you play this game and you will also be
        displayed in the Highscore of your friends. In addition, when your account
        is connected to a third-party account, a list of your friends who also
        participate in the same game and who have connected their same third-party
        account(s) with their game is shared with you. You can cancel the
        connection with your Facebook account at any time by logging into Facebook
        and selecting the “Settings” option. The connection between Facebook and
        the app can be deleted under “Apps and Websites.” You can cancel the
        connection with your Game Center account at any time in the settings menu
        of our games. You can cancel the connection with your other third-party
        accounts at any time by sending a message to our Player Support Team via
        in-game chat or via email to support@steamy-studio.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect this data to fulfil our contract by providing our app to you
        and to be able to connect your account if desired. We may also use this
        information on our legitimate interest to re-identify your player profile,
        for example when you lose access to your save game. To the extent that we,
        as described above, process your data for the purposes of providing the
        functions of our app (e.g. player ID), we require these information to
        provide you with our games and their functions. Without this data, we are
        not able to provide these functions to you. You are, however, not required
        to provide data of your third-party accounts and connect our games to
        them. Without this data, however, we are not able to provide the
        corresponding functions of our app to you.
      </p>

      <h3>3.3. Support requests</h3>
      <p>
        If you send support requests to us by email, via integrated HelpShift chat
        within the games or via messages within social media platforms, we collect
        and process the data from your request and data from your account, such as
        username and country. We only collect this data in order to appropriately
        respond to your questions, to provide our app to you and to be able to
        process your request based on the contract we passed when you accepted the
        Terms and Conditions. When you send support requests directly via the chat
        system integrated into our games, your provided personal data will be
        transmitted to our help desk provider HelpShift. By sending support
        requests via the chat system, you understand and agree with the
        transmission of the personal data required to process your support
        request. The data sent by you to us via contact requests remains with us
        until you request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the
        purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your
        request). Mandatory statutory provisions in particular statutory retention
        periods remain unaffected.
